![Webhook-Settings](./Images/webhook.png)

### Go to Jenkins web console, click "New Item" and create a "Freestyle project"

Create a New Item, name it Project 9 and select a Freestyle Project

![New-Item](./Images/create_freestyle.png)

In configuration of your Jenkins freestyle project choose Git repository, provide there the link to your Tooling GitHub repository and credentials (user/password) so Jenkins could access files in the repository. 

![New-Item](./Images/github_add_jenkins.png)

Save the configuration and  run the build by clicking on the Build Now. A number with Green colour shows that it is successful

![Build](./Images/build.png)

Open the build and check in "Console Output" if it has run successfully

![Build Console](./Images/build-console-success.png)

### Click "Configure" your job/project and add these two configurations

Configure triggering the job from GitHub webhook

![Build Trigger](./Images/jenkins_trigger.png)

Configure "Post-build Actions" to archive all the files â€“ files resulted from a build are called "artifacts"

![Build Artifacts](./Images/archive_artifacts.gif)

Now, go ahead and make some change in any file in your GitHub repository. Then come back to the Jenkins Console, You will notice that another build is up. Then check the Console Output for status

![Build Git Success](./Images/build-git-success.png)

Then on the Server, you can check the archive of the build with this command 

`ls /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/project9/builds/<build_number>/archive/`
